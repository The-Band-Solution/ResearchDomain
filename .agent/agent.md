# Agent and Project Context Index

This file serves as a high-level index and context guide for the `research_domain` project. It is designed to help both the AI Agent and the User navigate the codebase, understand the standards, and execute workflows efficiently.

## 1. Project Identity

- **Name**: `research_domain`
- **Description**: Library for managing research data including groups, campuses, universities, researchers, and papers.
- **Version**: Defined in `pyproject.toml` (currently `0.12.6`).
- **Ecosystem**: Part of "The Band Solution" (Enterprise Ontology). Depends on `libbase` and `eo_lib`.

## 2. Directory Structure

- **`.agent/`**: Agent configurations, instructions, and workflows.
    - `instructions.md`: **CRITICAL**. Contains Persona, Agile Standards, and Behavioral Rules (TDD, Clean Architecture).
    - `workflows/`: Standard operating procedures (e.g., `/bump-version`, `/verify`).
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.
    - `backlog.md`: Real-time backlog of Epics and User Stories.
    - `sdd.md`: Software Design Description (Architecture & Patterns).
    - `requirements.md`: Functional and non-functional requirements.
- **`src/`**: Source code.
    - `research_domain/`: Main package.
- **`tests/`**: Test suite (follows `pytest`).
- **`scripts/`**: Helper scripts for maintenance and automation.

## 3. Key Standards & Rules

> **Reference**: `.agent/instructions.md`

- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository).
- **Testing**: TDD is non-negotiable. 100% pass rate required for `pytest`.
- **Linting**: Strict adherence to `black`, `flake8`, `isort`.
- **Versioning**: SemVer 2.0.0.
- **Governance**: All work must be tracked in GitHub Issues and `docs/backlog.md`.

## 4. Common Commands & Workflows

| Action | Command / Workflow | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Codebase** | `/verify` | Runs full test suite and linting checks. |
| **Bump Version** | `/bump-version` | Updates version in `pyproject.toml` per SemVer. |
| **Run Tests** | `pytest` | Runs unit and integration tests. |
| **Build** | `hatch build` | Builds the project wheel. |
